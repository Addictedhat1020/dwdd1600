        <h1>Low Powered Blasters</h1>
        <!--put main stuff here-->
        <p>In the low powered blasters section you will find low powered blasters</p>
        <h2>History Of Low Powered Blasters</h2>
        <p>Low powered blasters first started when the Nerf Sharpshooter was released in 1992. It was the first blaster made that shot foam darts. After the Sharpshooter was released Nerf N-Strike eventualy came along and then Nerf N-Strike Elite and all the stuff after that.</p>
        <h2>Low Powered Blasters</h2>
        <p>Here are some of the main places low powered blasters come from.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Nerf N-Strike Elite</li>
            <li>Nerf N-Strike Elite 2.0</li>
            <li>Walmart Adventure Force*</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="af"><i>*Walmart Advenutre Force blasters are made by multiple dart blaster companies including Dart Zone, Buzzbee, and Zuru.</i></p>
        <p>There are tons of low powered blasters that have been made so I will go over some of the best ones.</p>
        <dl>
            <dt>Nerf Jolt</dt>
            <dd>A good small one shot blaster. The Jolt is a good backup blaster to have in your pocket.</dd>
            <dt>Nerf Elite Rapidstrike</dt>
            <dd>A fast shooting flywheel blaster. The Rapidstrike is a good flywheel blaster to use as a primary.</dd>
            <dt>Nerf Elite Retaliator</dt>
            <dd>A pump action springer blaster. The Retaliator is a very good pump action springer to use as a primary.</dd>
            <dt>Nerf Stryfe</dt>
            <dd>A smaller flywheel blaster. The Stryfe is a very good flywheel blaster that is tactical and can be used in many situations.</dd>
            <dt>Nerf Elite Rampage</dt>
            <dd>A pump action springer blaster. The Rampage is a good pump action springer and comes with a cool 25 round drum mag.</dd>
            <dt>Nerf Elite Roughcut</dt>
            <dd>A pump action springer blaster. The Roughcut is a good secondary shotgun blaster that can shoot 2 darts at a time.</dd>

        </dl>
        <h2>Purchase recommendations</h2>
        <p>When purchasing a blaster you should choose carefully. I recommend staying away from the Elite 2.0 line because it has lots of janky, low-quality, crappy blasters that are not good. I would recommend staying away from Nerf's newer blasters because Nerf's newer products are just crappy reskins of older blasters and you can find much better quality blasters elsewhere. I would recommend getting something from the Elite line if you want a good blaster. These are just recommendations so you don't have to follow them.</p>
        <p>Here are the blasters I recommend getting if you want a low powered blaster.</p>
        <h3>The Nerf Rapidstrike</h3>
        <p>The Rapidstrike is a good flywheel primary blaster and will be able to take down your targets fast.</p>
        <h3>The Nerf Retaliator</h3>
        <p>The Retaliator is a good springer primary and is a great basic blaster to bring to a Nerf war.</p>
        <h3>The Nerf Roughcut</h3>
        <p>The Roughcut is a great secondary blaster to use as a shotgun when you need it.</p>
        <h3>The Nerf Motoblitz</h3>
        <p>The Motoblitz is one of the only good blasters in the Elite 2.0 line and is a great primary. You can use the 8-shot master key when you are out of darts and in trouble and your enemies won't be expect it.</p>
        <h3>The Nerf Jolt</h3>
        <p>The Jolt is a great backup blaster to have in your pocket when you get in a sticky situation.</p>
        <h2>Higher Powered Low Powered Blasters</h2>
        <p>There are some higher powered low powered blasters that Dart Zone makes that are really good.</p>
        <p>Here are the best of the higher powered low powered blasters</p>
        <dl>
            <dt>The Villianator</dt>
            <dd>The Villianator is a great springer blaster with a high capacity.</dd>
            <dt>The Spectrum</dt>
            <dd>The Spectrum is a great basic flywheel blaster.</dd>
