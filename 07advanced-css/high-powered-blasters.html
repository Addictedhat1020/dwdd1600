        <h1>High Powered Blasters</h1>
        <!--put main stuff here-->
        <h2>History Of High Powered Blasters</h2>
        <p>High powered blasters first started in the Nerf hobby when people were making 3D printed blasters that shot cut-down long darts. Dart Zone came in in 2019 when they relesed the MK1. It was the first blaster you could buy from a blaster company that was injection molded plastic. In 2020 the Nexus Pro was released on shelves and was the first high powered blaster you could buy on shelf.</p>
        <h2>High Powered Blasters</h2>
        <p>There are lots of good high powered blasters you can get so here are some of the best in my opinion.</p>
        <dl>
            <dt>The Nexus Pro</dt>
            <dd>The Nexus Pro is a very good, cheap blaster to get you into high powered blasting.</dd>
            <dt>The MK2</dt>
            <dd>The MK2 is a small, compact pistol blaster that is a very good secondary.</dd>
            <dt>The Tomcat</dt>
            <dd>The Tomcat is a good springer blaster that has a 50 round short dart drum.</dd>
            <dt>The MK3</dt>
            <dd>The MK3 is a flywheel blaster that is good a single shot flywheel blaster.</dd>
            <dt>The MK2.1</dt>
            <dd>The MK2.1 is a magazine fed pistol blaster that is a good secondary and primary.</dd>
            <dt>The Solo Pro</dt>
            <dd>The Solo Pro is a very good compact backup blaster.</dd>
        </dl>
        <h2>Purchase Recommendations</h2>
        <p>I would recommend getting whatever you need. There are tons of different pro blasters for almost every play style and need. If you need a primary springer then you can get the Nexus Pro and if you need a primary flywheel then you can get the MK3 and so on.</p>
        <h3>The Nexus Pro</h3>
        <p>The Nexus Pro is a very good, cheap primary springer and is a very good way to get into high powered blasting.</p>
        <h3>The Tomcat</h3>
        <p>The Tomcat is a good high capacity springer.</p>
        <h3>The MK 2</h3>
        <p>The MK 2 is a very good compact secondary blaster</p>
        <h3>The Solo Pro</h3>
        <p>The Solo Pro is a very good compact backup blaster that still hits hard.</p>
