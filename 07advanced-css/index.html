        <h2>History of Nerf</h2>
        <p>The popular dart blaster brand Nerf was started by Reyn Guyer and they made foam balls. He made the hit Nerf Ball and relesed it in 1969. He then went on to make a blaster that shot the Nerf Ball. He eventually made blasters that shot foam darts.</p>
        <h2>History of Nerf Blasters</h2>
        <p>In 2008 the N-Strike blaster line was made and shaped the modern blasters we know today.The N-Strike Elite blaster line launched in 2012 improved the N-Strike blasters.</p>
        <h2>History of High powered blasters.</h2>

        <p>Eventually 3D printed high powered blasters started to catch on and there was lots of high powered 3D printed blasters being made. In 2020 the <b>revolutionary</b> Nexus Pro was made by <a href="https://dartzoneblasters.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dart Zone</a> and it changed the course of dart blaster history. The <a href="https://dartzoneblasters.com/product/adventure-force-nexus-pro-ultimate-dart-blaster/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nexus Pro</a> was the first high powered blaster to be sold on shelves with no assembly required. You could buy it off the shelf and take it straight to a nerf war and be able to use it without putting it together first. The Nexus Pro had the option to shoot short darts that are able to fly <i>faster</i> and <i>farther</i>. The Aeon Pro was released shortly after the Nexus Pro and was a smaller version of the Nexus Pro with the same power. Other blaster companies started making high powered blasters and eventually in 2023 Nerf released the Strife X with there own short darts. Dart zone made a lot more high powered blasters after the Nexus Pro like the MK 1.1, MK 2, MK 3, and tons more blasters you can check out on <a href="https://dartzoneblasters.com/product-category/blasters/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">their website</a>.</p>
